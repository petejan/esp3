Create a data struct containing power, sv, sp, angles etc, (all the data which are in datamat from sub_data) for each transceiver and that you save with:
save('tranceiver_name.mat','-struct','data_struct'v7.3');

Then you can load it with:
data_struct=matfile('transceiver_name');
and use it with data_struct.(datamat(idx_curr).Name); depending on which data you need at the time.

This way each we'll be able to work on several layer at the same time as the memory will not be affected!

A good way to code that will be to create a get_sub_data_mat method in the data_cl class that will return a matrix containing the ask datamat, after having read it from the appropriate .mat file.

Done...
Lots of testing to do as it changes a lot of things... Looks a lot faster to me...
