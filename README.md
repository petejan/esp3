# What is ESP3?

ESP3 is an open-source software for visualizing and processing fisheries acoustics data, written in MATLAB. It is developed and is maintained by the deepwater fisheries acoustics team at NIWA (Wellington, New Zealand). Contributions to the project are encouraged!

# How do I get it and run it?

You have two options:

1. If you have **MATLAB R2016a** (or more recent) and a small number of **required toolboxes**, you can simply get the source code and run it.

2. If you don't use MATLAB (or don't have the necessary version and toolboxes), you can download and run the stand-alone, compiled version:

* First, download and install the free [Matlab Compiler Runtime R2016a (9.0.1)](https://au.mathworks.com/supportfiles/downloads/R2016a/deployment_files/R2016a/installers/win64/MCR_R2016a_win64_installer.exe).

* Next, download and run [the installer for the ESP3 compiled version](https://sourceforge.net/projects/esp3/files/).

# I have MATLAB. How do I get the source code and run the program?

Follow the Downloads link in the menu bar on the left and it will get you the latest version of the project's source code. Once downloaded on your local machine, just run "EchoAnalysis.m" from the ESP3 root folder.

If it runs well, we encourage you to install Git and "fork" the project, rather than simply downloading it. Doing so will also download the source code but allow you to keep it updated to the latest version. [Learn about version controlling, Git and "forking" here](https://www.atlassian.com/git?utm_source=bitbucket&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=help_dropdown&utm_content=learn_git)

If you're familiar with Git, don't hesitate to clone the project and help contributing.
