	<p><b>ESP3</b> is an open-source software package for visualising and processing active acoustics data, developed at NIWA (Wellington, New Zealand) by the Fisheries Monitoring and Acoustics group.
ESP3 is designed for single-beam and split-beam echosounder data. The software has been written mainly for processing fisheries acoustic surveys, with attention to reproducibility, consistency and efficiency. 
Although ESP3 was developed to visualise and process single and multi-frequency SIMRAD EK60 and EK80 raw data, it also supports, to some extent, other formats (e.g., NIWA CREST, Furuno FCV-30 and ASL AZFP). 
</p>
<p>The software allows standard post-processing and analysis of fisheries acoustic survey data such as calibration, scrutinisation using in-house algorithms 
(e.g, bad transmits identification, automated bottom detection, single targets detection and tracking, schools detection, etc.) and others developed by the scientific community (e.g., background noise removal), multi-frequency analysis and echo-integration.
ESP3 is always under further development and new versions, features and algorithms are frequently released, so keep an eye on the project!
