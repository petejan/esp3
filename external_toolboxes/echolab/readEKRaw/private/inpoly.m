function [in,bnd] = inpoly(p,node,cnect)

% Determine which points are inside a 2D polygonal region via the crossing 
% number test. Should be much faster than inpolygon.
%
% TWO INPUT CALL:
%
%   [in,bnd] = inpoly(p,node)
%
% The first input is an Nx2 vector defining the points to be tested:
%
%   p = [x1,y1; x2,y2; etc]
%
% The second input defines the vertices of the polygon, which are assumed
% to be passed in consectutive order (so that the 1st is joined to the 2nd 
% and so on):
%
%   node  = [x1,y1; x2,y2; etc], endpoints of boundaries
%
% Two length N logical arrays 'in' and 'bnd' are returned. The first is
% true for points inside and on the boundaries of the region, while the
% second is true for points on the boundary only.
%
% THREE INPUT CALL:
%
%   [in,bnd] = inpoly(p,node,cnect)
% 
% Where the extra input explicitly defines the connectivity of the polygon:
%
%   cnect = [n1,n2; n2,n3; etc], boundary connectivity via node numbers
%
% This syntax is much more general and allows the specification of multiply
% connected domains (polygons with "islands").
%
% Type "polydemo" to see some examples.
%
% See also INPOLYGON

% The crossing number test determines point inclusion by counting the
% number of times a line from a point cuts the geometry of the polygon. If
% the count is even the point is outside, odd inside. Special care needs to
% be taken on boundaries and at the polygon vertices.
%
% This code gains efficiency by partitioning the test into a series of
% stages. The xy co-ordinates of each point is first checked against the
% bounding box for each wall so the expensive line intersection checking
% need only be done for points that are close to the boundaries.
%
% Additional efficiency is also gained by initially partitioning the walls
% into two groups, upper and lower, depending on their y co-ordinate. This
% means that, in general, only half the walls need to be checked for each
% point.
%
% Google "crossing number test" for more info.

% P.S: Don't try and tell me a vectorised code will be faster, it isn't,
% I've checked. Escpecially as of R14 loop based code can be significantly
% faster, espec when involving scalar boolean &&, ||, etc. Anyway, sorry,
% but that's my little rant...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% UPDATE 18/03/2006:
%
% Added output 'bnd' which is a length N logical array that is true for
% points on the boundaries of the polygon, as per MATLAB's INPOLYGON. It
% should be noted though, that detection of points "exactly" on the
% boundaries is prone to round-off error (This is also true of INPOLYGON).
%
% Also changed I/O so that if 'cnect' is not passed it is built by assuming
% the nodes are in consecutive order.
%
% Many thanks to Urs Schwarz and John D'Errico.
