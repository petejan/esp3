%
% DESCRIPTION:
%    SEAWATER is a toolkit of MATLAB routines for calculating the
%    properties of sea water. They are a self contained library and
%    are extremely easy to use and will run on all computers that 
%    support MATLAB.  I should also mention that SEAWATER is FREE.  
%
% MATLAB:
%    For information on MATLAB contact info@mathworks.com
%       
% DISCLAIMER
%   This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
%   See the file sw_copy.m for conditions of use and licence.

%   "SEAWATER: A Library of MATLAB Computational Routines for the 
%   Properties of Sea Water". CSIRO Marine Laboratories Report 222. 29pp.
%
%   The above reference is highly recommended as it fully describes
%   the sources of algorithms, conventions and also includes a
%   tutorial for oceanographers.
%
%   Reference is available from: 
%       The Librarian 
%       CSIRO Division of Oceanography

%     
%       or via email to:  library@ml.csiro.au
%
% DATA FOR TUTORIAL:
%   The data file sw_data.mat can be loaded into matlab using the commands
%      datafile = which('sw_data.mat');
%      eval(['load ' datafile])  
%   See the reference report for full description and tutorial.
% 
% EMAIL CONTACT:
%   It is best if you send all email correspondence to the address
%       seawater@ml.csiro.au
%   rather than me personally as I often spend a number of months
%   each year working at sea and can not be contacted via email. At
%   these times another person may be assigned to answer the email.
%
%   The email address seawater@ml.csiro.au will automatically acknowledge 
%   your message and log your email for processing.
%
% IMPROVEMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS:
%   Please report any bugs so we update the master set of routines.
%   When reporting bugs please send a subset of the data you are
%   using, a diary of your matlab session and the results that you
%   think you should be getting. You MUST also send the release
%   version and date of SEAWATER that you are using - see information
%   at the top of this page.
%
%   If you have another routines that would be useful additions
%   then please send them to me.  Of course, copyright will stay 
%   with you (the author).
%
% COMMENTS:
%   We would also be interested in what areas of research and what
%   uses you have found for this library - very important for
%   resources to be made available to maintain the library.
%
% UPDATES:
%   The code will be placed on the anonymous ftp site aqueous.ml.csiro.au 
%   (192.67.12.100) under the directory /pub/morgan/seawater. Files 
%   are available individually or in one tar file seawater.tar and
%   also in seawater.tar.Z. Information about changes from one release
%   to another will be in a file called sw_new.m
%
%   Update versions will be announced via the newsgroup
%   comp.soft-sys.matlab.  You may wish to periodically check the ftp
%   site for updates.
%
% REGISTRATION:
%   You can also register as a user by sending your email address
%   to seawater@ml.csiro.au. I will attempt to personally inform you
%   of any updates etc.
%
% INSTALLATION:
%   I suggest you place all the SEAWATER routines in a directory
%   called seawater and set your matlab path to that directory.  
%   See the matlab command "help path" for more details.
